# Beholder: DnD 5e Party Visualization Tool
   Beyond doesn't have a free API, so I'm using the [DND5eAPI](http://www.dnd5eapi.co/#)

## Goals for this project

    - Familiarize myself with REST API
    - Resharpen my React TS skills
    - Create something that I can use while running 5e for my friends


## Features to implement

    - Create characters and populate a party
    - Load relevent information from DND5eAPI
    - Average damage, range, AC calculations for the party
    - Rank party members based on given stats
    - Allow for the creation of homebrew items
    - Locally save a party to load later
    - Pretty CSS
